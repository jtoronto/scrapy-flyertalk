Sounds like the easiest way is to just check in manually and not bother with the Kiosk, which is what I do almost all of the time anyway. Only reason I tried is that there was a large family with complicated check in clogging the priority line. Of course, once I had failed at the Kiosk, several additional families had joined the priority line in the meantime. <img src=\"https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/images/smilies/biggrin.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Big Grin\" class=\"inlineimg\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>"}

I would gladly pay a few hundred more to secure my GPU on UA.</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>I think the key to finding space at booking is (1) being creative about where you start, (2) being creative about your destination (3) having a powerful tool to find C space and (4) having a powerful tool to assess possible routings.  I know that sounds like common sense, but it can work.  If you just want DFW-LHR-DFW and wont be flexible on routing or say going to MAN instead of LHR then all bets are off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got my wife upgraded on SEA-ORD-MAN-LHR/MAN-PHL-SEA last may, ticket was $800 less by adding the segment to LHR on to outbound and returning from MAN instead of LHR (actually had to call and book by phone to get it to price correctly).  Just flew JFK-LHR-ORD-SEA with her last week, both of us confirmed at booking into biz and by dropping SEA-JFK off and just buying an economy ticket to the east coast it dropped the price to $600 range. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for either of these, if I had just opened up AA.com and done some searches I wouldn't have seen anything that had SWUs.  Key is (1) find cheapest fare pairs across the pond (2) look for C space on all the possible AA flights across the pond (3) play with routing to see if you can get those flights with upgrade space to return availability in the lowest fare buckets (like O) (4) go to AA.com and book (or call) and then call immediately apply SWUs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>"}

I explained that since MIA-GRU cleared, I would like to be waitlisted as a miles+copay waitlist since that takes priority over the standard complimentary upgrades.  Agent told me they couldn't add me to that list since my other leg cleared.  I pushed back and asked her to check with supervisor since the miles+copay upgrade award includes up to 3 legs, and if one of them isn't available I should be waitlisted with the correct priority.  She came back and informed me that I was upgraded all the way through.  Checked my rez and it was all set.  Note: PHL-MIA did *NOT* have \"C\" upgrade inventory when I called/was on the phone with her, so there must have been an override by a supervisor.

However, when I do a multicity, or separate award booking, it comes up on the website. The connecting flight is the next AM, but the layover itself is less than 9 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the issue is that it doubles the cost of the ticket from 12.5K to 25K. Party of 4 basically means I'm spending an extra 50K.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there something that can be done to price this out as the 12.5K?

Maybe phrase it a little differently.  Don't mention HEL or AY until you've given them your origin, destination, and dates, and you are talking about possible routings (then feed them flight numbers)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor many agents, if you start off saying that you want to fly AAA-BBB-CCC they are going to enter exactly that and you will get a multi city booking (ie, 2 awards).  So you always start off saying that you want to fly AAA - CCC.  BBB (in this case HEL, but I think it's good advice in general) should not be mentioned until the last step when looking at possible routings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>"}

Even if you have zero Avios at the moment, an Avios subscription might be worthwhile. The only caveat is the subscription has a 2 or 3 month minimum sub. So if your trip is imminent then you'd have to buy more up front rather than let them trickle in over a few months.... then it might not be worth it if you don't use Avios regularly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>"}

Now that the merger has closed, i wonder if the city/airlines will update their plans.</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>The following part of the $6B FAA CEP Plan has been agreed to by US Airways (Parker) - prior to the merger and includes approx. $800M in funding commitments for:<br>\r\n\u2022 A 1,500ft extension of runway 9L-27R that increases the total runway length to 12,000ft, providing the capability to accommodate large, long-haul aircraft flying to any point on the globe<br>\r\n\u2022 A redesigned and enhanced Terminal B and C ticketing area, which will include an automated baggage handling and screening system and a more spacious, centralised passenger security screening checkpoint to provide for greater efficiency and enhanced passenger flow<br>\r\n\u2022 Replacement of the current rental car facility surface lots with a multi-story consolidated rental car facility<br>\r\n\u2022 An initial design for an automated people-mover system between concourses that will make it easier for passengers to connect to other flights<br>\r\n\u2022 Airside improvements to include new taxiway/aircraft holding bays/apron to better queue for departure<br>\r\n\u2022 Continued rehabilitation of other existing airport infrastructure projects, including security upgrades, roof and window replacements, escalator upgrades, airport restrooms, roadways, concession programs and flight information display systems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time the above was agreed, US and the airport extended their lease agreement to June 30, 2015. I don't believe the above can be dismissed, except in Bankruptcy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ? is, what are the new AA's future plans for PHL and how will that affect further funding committments (by Parker) ?<br>\r\nFor example, do A-West and A-East have sufficient gate space to support significant international expansion? A while back, the city proposed to expand A-West by decreasing gate seperation and/or extending the end of the terminal to the existing south hanger, which I believe was the old TWA hanger. Of course now with the merged US/AA, it would possibly be easier to just make A-East an all new (AA) terminal and connect all (unconnected) gates to the CIS.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>"}

Rendering it allows it to be absorbed by the meat while it rests, and also a lot of it melts off.  When I cook ribeyes I end up with significant amounts of liquid fat left in the pan.   I find that beef fat melts very quickly at high temperatures (the fat comes off while it's searing) as opposed to something like bacon, where you need to go low and slow to render the fat off and get it crispy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>"}
